## Contribute Translation

Sign up account on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gogs) and fill untranslate strings.

Sometimes, you will find it's quite hard to translate a sentence from English to your language, do not panic! Just present the idea and don't have to match the exact words in English version.

In case you want to test your translation, and avoid make changes in Git history, you can put your locale file into `custom/conf/locale/<file>` and restart Gogs.

## Custom Locale Files

If you're not satisfied with official locale translation, you can modify those fields with another file in `custom/conf/locale/locale_<lang>.ini`, and then restart Gogs.
